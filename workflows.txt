importSpectrum()
  1. Use this workflow to import mass spectra in mzML or mzXML formats

Assign chemical formulae to selected m/z within ppm mass accuracy
  1. Generate bank of chemical formulae
  2. generate vector of m/z values obtained from spectrum
  3. Match cheical formula from bank to m/z value from spectrum to with ppm mass accuracy
  
Apply a priori connectivity knowledge to chemical formulae to access another layer
  1. Assign possible formulae to m/z value based on an atomic bank
  2. Create bank of predefined molecular units, based on a priori definitions. Examples include glycan monosaccharides or amino acids.
  N.B.: The bank of molecular units is meant to be matched to the same m/z data as the atomic bank.
  3. transform formula into matrix
  4. factor molecular units into formulae
  5. plot mass defect

Match m/z to (formula +/- fragment)
  1. 

Find unknown fragments or additions between two MS spectra
  1. Systematically subtract spectra
  2. Keep list of differences
  3. Solve differences for formulae
  
Find differences within spectra - diff.list() method
  1. 
  
FInd differences within spectra -
