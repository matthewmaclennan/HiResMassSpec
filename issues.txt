Next step involves making the blindSpotStarter function allow for approximate overlap. Currently, the atom masses are rounded and 
the derivative formulae are calculated based on exact matches for overlap. It would be beneficial to include:

1. Approximate overlap, as in overlap to within a ppm error. I suspect the result of this would be much more reasonable sets of 
derivative formulae, meaning much smaller denominators.

1a. Use derivative formulae to create a set of chemical formulae within a mass range useful for mass spectral analysis and plotting.
1b. Include the charge (m/z) component. This is from the perspective of mass spectrometry. 
1c. How do m/z with |z|>1 affect the overlap spaces in molecule sets and derivative formulae?

2. Generate formulae from a formulaic n-rule (e.g. CnH2n-ZOm) and a mass range cutoff.*

3. Generate SMILES from formulaic n-rule and scaffold. Can Marvinsketch already do this with restricted isomer enumerations?*
